# Instagram Engagement Analysis for Company X

## Project Overview
Company X has entrusted us with the task of conducting a comprehensive analysis of their Instagram data to facilitate better data-driven decision-making. The primary focus of this project is to answer the key question: What type of content receives the highest engagement on Company X's Instagram account?

## Project Scope

### Data Availability

We have access to the Instagram database containing information from the initial post on the brand's account up until March 27.

### Objectives

The project aims to answer the following questions:

1. What type of content garners the most engagement on Company X's Instagram?
2. How do likes, comments, and interactions vary across different types of content?

### Guidelines

- The views column in the database is deemed irrelevant for this analysis and should be disregarded.
- Empty tags, defined as those without a tag, should be treated as empty during the analysis.

## Project Steps

1. Setup and Data Collection:
- Access the Instagram database.
- Clean the data, considering the provided guidelines.
- Create a GitHub repository and set up the project environment.
2. Data Analysis:
